Game Introduction: The Pokémon training game is an interactive console-based application where users can engage in training and evolving Pokémon.

Structural Foundation: The game is built using the C programming language and utilizes structures to represent Pokémon, including attributes such as name, type, level, and experience.

Randomized Training: The training mechanism involves gaining a random amount of experience points between 1 and 10, simulating the unpredictability of training outcomes.

Evolution Feature: Pokémon have the potential to evolve when reaching a certain level. Evolution is triggered at level 3, changing the Pokémon's name and type.

User Interaction: Users interact with the game through a console interface, choosing options like displaying Pokémon, training a Pokémon, or quitting the game.

Display Pokémon Information: The game allows users to view detailed information about a specific Pokémon, including its name, type, level, and experience.

Training Pokémon: Users can select a Pokémon to undergo training, gaining experience points. The game tracks and displays the gained experience.

Leveling Up: Pokémon level up when their experience reaches or exceeds 100 points. Upon leveling up, the Pokémon gains a level, and if it's the third level, it undergoes evolution.

Evolution Mechanism: Evolution is a key feature triggered at level 3. It appends "(Evolved)" to the Pokémon's name and changes its type, simulating the Pokémon's growth.

Game Loop: The main game loop allows users to perform actions repeatedly, choosing between displaying Pokémon, training them, or quitting the game.
